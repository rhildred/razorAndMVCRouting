## Notes

The **assignment** evaluates the learning objective in the course outline:

2.1 Evaluate the various .NET data structures
	2.1.1 Discuss the use of these ADO.NET components: dataset, data table, data adapter, command, and connection.
	
3.3 Analyze the use of the MVC design pattern.
	3.3.1 Outline the model, view, and controller of the MVC design pattern.
	3.3.3 Discuss the use of the Razor view engine and routing in an ASP.NET MVC application.

It also covers points from the lesson plan relating to the same outcomes. By actually implementing a prototype students will gather the experience they need to perform these outcomes at the evaluation level of the cognitive domain.

The **lecture** sticks with the 3.3.3 learning outcome. By comparing and contrasting MVC with webform and razor pages architectures students will be well equipped to discuss the outcome.
